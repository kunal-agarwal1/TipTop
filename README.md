Submitted by: **Kunal Agarwal**

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [x] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [ ] UI animations
* [x] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [x] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Added the Custom tip function to enable the user of the app to enter a specific tip amount
- [x] Edited the Auto resizing for a few view to enable different screen sizes to work, but constraints arenâ€™t fully implemented.
- [x] App can handle the display of large numbers, and will use 'K' to represent thousands and 'M' to represent millions.
- [x] The App icon and a simple launch screen were designed and added.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
Some challenges faced included:

- Using the Date object to track how much time had passed to remember the bill amount.
- Designing the UI, mainly picking which color and shades to use.
